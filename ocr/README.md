# OCRed output

## what's here
### OCRmyPDF
I ran [OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) against the original document.

[The optimized PDF is posted in Releases.](https://github.com/pronoiac/altair-basic-source-code/releases/tag/v0.0.1)

[The recognized text is here.](ocrmypdf.txt)
It's not incredibly legible, but at least it's much smaller than the original scanned PDF!
